By doing this course, I have only been able to learn web development, but not. I have learned how to do time management. Support sessions, deadlines for your assignments, course outlines are awesome. Moderates, admin brothers have suffered a lot. Every time I posted a help, I got a reply from the comments of the moderator / admin brothers. Many times I dropped out of the course due to family issues, exams, etc. It was really awesome when Jhangkar's brother inspired me to come back to the course with a zoom session. When I get frustrated again and again, I remember one of the words of Jhangkar Bhai: Life will have problems, obstacles will come, you have to deal with them. Many topics in the course will be a little shaky. If it weren't for the shock, everyone in the world would be a web developer. The problem actually has its solution. You have to find the solution. These words have inspired me a lot. It's really awesome to find out by call, email.",
